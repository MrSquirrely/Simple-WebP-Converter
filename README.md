# Simple-WebP-Converter
A simple program to convert a batch of images to the WebP format.

# About
I created this cause I needed a way to convert a whole bunch of images to the WebP format so I could save some space on my website. I created it as simple as I could!
My second goal was to create this only needing one file, and that's all you need.

# How to use
Just drag the images you want to convert onto the EXE and it'll convert them. It will create a folder called "Old" and move the old images there so you can have a backup. You can't change this, and no I'm not going to add the ability to do so.
